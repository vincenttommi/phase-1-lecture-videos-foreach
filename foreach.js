// Array.prototype.forEach()
//foreach method excutes a provided function  for each array element

const array1 = ["a", "b","c"];

array1.forEach(element => console.log(element));


// The forEach() method is an iterative method. It calls a
// provided callbackFn function once for each element in an array in ascending-index order. Unlike map(), forEach() always returns undefined and is not chainable. The typical use 
//case is to execute side effects at the end of a chain.
